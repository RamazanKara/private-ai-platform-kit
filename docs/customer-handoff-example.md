# Customer Handoff Example

This example uses a fake customer organization, `acme-ai`, to show the expected handoff flow without assuming a cloud provider.

## Inputs

- Customer Git mirror: `https://github.com/acme-ai/private-ai-platform-kit.git`
- Target revision: `v0.23.0`
- GPU profile: `nvidia`
- Runtime model: `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next`
- API key hashes: stored in the customer secret backend and surfaced through External Secrets

## Configure The Overlay

```bash
make customer-overlay \
  CUSTOMER_REPO_URL=https://github.com/acme-ai/private-ai-platform-kit.git \
  CUSTOMER_REVISION=v0.23.0 \
  CUSTOMER_GPU_PROFILE=nvidia
```

Review the generated changes in:

- `deploy/gitops/argocd/root-app-customer.yaml`
- `deploy/clusters/customer/apps.yaml`
- `deploy/clusters/customer/values/inference-gateway.yaml`
- `deploy/clusters/customer/values/vllm-nvidia.yaml`
- `deploy/clusters/customer/values/rag-service.yaml`

## Customer Decisions

- Confirm GPU nodes expose `nvidia.com/gpu` and have `platform.ai/node-pool=gpu`.
- Confirm API-key hashes are sourced from the customer secret backend.
- Replace model provenance source-reference digests with customer model-store artifact digests.
- Replace sample RAG knowledge with approved customer documents and matching Qdrant dimensions.
- Review agent workspace egress against `platform/network/egress-catalog.yaml`.

## Handoff Proof

After sync, capture:

```bash
make smoke RUNTIME_BACKEND=vllm
make rag-smoke
make eval
make loadtest
make evidence LIVE=1
make release-gate-strict
```

Attach the generated Markdown reports and keep JSON evidence with the release or handoff record.

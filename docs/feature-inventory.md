# Feature inventory

This is the release-level source of truth for what `v0.29.0` implements, what is enabled by
default, and what remains operator-owned. “Shipped” means code, configuration, tests, and an
operator path exist in this repository; it does not mean a customer-specific integration is
configured.

| Capability | Status | Default | Verification / boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI chat completions | Shipped | On | Gateway tests, OpenAPI contract, local smoke |
| Legacy completions | Shipped | On, non-streaming | Gateway tests; streaming rejected explicitly |
| Embeddings | Shipped | On | Gateway tests; same auth, budget, audit, and model policy |
| Moderations | Shipped | On | Governance taxonomy, not OpenAI harm categories |
| Anthropic Messages | Shipped | On, streaming and non-streaming | Native translation through the governed chat path; streaming obeys the shared `allowStreaming` toggle |
| OpenAI Responses | Shipped | On, synchronous | Optional state is off by default; background and streaming remain out of scope |
| Responses server-side state | Shipped | Off | Tenant-scoped memory/Redis store with TTL and delete |
| Synchronous batch fan-out | Shipped | On | Per-item admission/budget/guardrail tests |
| Files + asynchronous Batch API | Shipped | Off | Bounded streaming upload, durable Redis queue, object-store blobs |
| Python client SDK | Shipped | GitHub release downloads | Isolated build/test matrix, checksums, and release artifacts; PyPI Trusted Publishing is optional |
| API-key authentication | Shipped | Local on; chart base off | Hashed keys or scoped/expiring key records |
| JWT/JWKS authentication | Shipped | Customer template on | Issuer/audience/time/algorithm validation and tenant binding |
| Model allowlist and routing | Shipped | On | Per-model primary/fallback/canary/shadow routes |
| Runtime failover | Shipped | Configured by policy | Readiness accepts a healthy declared fallback chain |
| Prompt and tool-payload admission | Shipped | On | Recursive secret/blocked-term scan and size ceilings |
| Output guardrail | Shipped | Off in base values | Scans visible content and generated tool/function arguments |
| Request/body limits | Shipped | 1 MiB JSON | Files use the independent bounded batch-file ceiling |
| Rate limits and budgets | Shipped | Customer Redis profile on | Atomic shared counters; fixed windows; reservations settled against measured usage; fail policy is explicit |
| Tamper-evident audit receipts | Shipped | On | Redacted fingerprints, chain verifier, head anchors, and chain-of-chains continuity across restarts |
| Agent-action receipts | Shipped | Off | `POST /v1/receipts`; closed action vocabulary, tenant-bound, records claims and enforces nothing (ADR 0014) |
| RAG retrieval receipts | Shipped | On | Own chain, same primitives and same verifier as the gateway |
| Audit chain head persistence | Shipped | Memory (no continuity) | `file` or `redis` backend needed for cross-restart linkage; storage is operator-provided |
| Read-only operator console | Shipped | Off | `/console`; health, models, usage, and budget only |
| Ollama runtime | Shipped | Local profile | Pinned image; local-only model-pull egress exception |
| vLLM generation runtime | Shipped | Customer profile | NVIDIA/AMD values, explicit task, queue-based autoscaling |
| vLLM embedding runtime | Shipped | Customer profile | Dedicated `--task embed` release consumed by RAG |
| Lexical and Qdrant RAG | Shipped | Lexical local; Qdrant customer | Hybrid retrieval, reranker interface, collection versioning |
| RAG tenant isolation | Shipped | App default on; local shared profile off | Query and document metadata both fail closed by owner |
| Agent sandbox workspace | Shipped | Local/customer profiles | Restricted pod, no ambient token, scoped token, PVC, quotas |
| Network-policy enforcement | Shipped | Calico local default | Reachable-target deny smoke; customer CNI remains operator-owned |
| GitOps delivery | Shipped | Argo CD | Immutable release revisions; every declared app is health-gated and customer sync fails closed |
| Evidence and release gates | Shipped | CI/nightly | Conformance and model-quality evidence are labeled separately |
| Client-SDK conformance | Shipped | On demand (`make sdk-conformance`) | Real `openai`/`anthropic` clients against a mock runtime; SDKs live in a throwaway venv |
| Egress exception expiry | Shipped | Report-only | Rendered onto the NetworkPolicy; Kyverno denies expired, CronJob retires them when enforcement is on |
| SBOM, provenance, signatures | Shipped | Release CI | Build once, promote digest, digest-bound charts, Sigstore bundles |
| Multi-node model serving | Example/integration | Off | LeaderWorkerSet/Ray installation and topology are operator-owned |
| End-user multi-user chat UI | Example only | Off | Open WebUI manifest/runbook; identity and storage are operator-owned |
| Training, fine-tuning, audio, images | Out of scope | n/a | Use purpose-built systems; see [Scope and non-goals](scope-and-non-goals.md) |

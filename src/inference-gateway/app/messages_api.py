"""The native Anthropic Messages route (``POST /v1/messages``).

The endpoint is a translation shell around the same governed chat path chat uses:
``app.messages`` converts the Anthropic request to the internal OpenAI chat shape on the
way in and the completion (or chunk stream) back to Anthropic events on the way out,
so Anthropic-SDK agents get native streaming without a second, weaker governance path.

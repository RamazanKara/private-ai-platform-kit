"""The shared rail every governed inference endpoint runs on.

Every inference endpoint does the same four things around its own logic: resolve the
model route, reserve sandbox budget, map one failure taxonomy onto the OpenAI-shaped
error envelope, and record exactly one receipt (metrics, settlement, audit) per request.
Until v0.28.x each handler carried a private copy of that tail - five near-identical
blocks of exception mapping and end-of-request recording that had to be edited in five
places to stay identical. This module is that tail, written once.

The contract: a handler opens :func:`governed`, does its endpoint-specific work inside,
and keeps the yielded :class:`GovernedCall` current (backend after routing, the payload
the receipt should fingerprint, the runtime response once it exists). The rail owns what
happens when the work raises and what gets recorded when it ends, on the success and
failure paths alike. Streaming handlers hand recording to their stream body by setting
``stream_owns_recording`` and calling :func:`record_stream_end` at true end-of-stream,
because for a stream the request is not over when the headers are.

Except-order in the rail is load-bearing: ``AdmissionPolicyError`` subclasses
``ValueError``, so the admission arm must come first or every policy rejection would be
misreported as a malformed runtime response.

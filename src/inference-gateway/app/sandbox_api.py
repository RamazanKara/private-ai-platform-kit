"""Sandbox-scoped read routes and the agent-action receipt intake.

The reads (budget, usage, models) are the data layer the admin console and client SDK
render; the receipt intake (ADR 0014) is the one governed write surface that records
claims without enforcing anything. All of them answer only for the caller's bound
sandbox, which the auth middleware pinned before any handler runs.

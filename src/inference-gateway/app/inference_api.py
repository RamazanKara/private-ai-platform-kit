"""OpenAI-compatible inference routes: chat, completions, embeddings, moderations, batch.

Every handler here runs on the shared governance rail (``app.governance``): one model
policy, one budget reservation, one failure taxonomy, one receipt per request. The
handlers own only what makes their endpoint distinct - chat's failover chain and SSE
stream, completions' prompt-shaped budget synthesis, embeddings' input metering, the
moderations classifier, and the synchronous batch fan-out.

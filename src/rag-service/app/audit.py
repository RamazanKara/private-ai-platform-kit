"""Tamper-evident audit-chain primitives for RAG retrieval receipts.

A chain covers one process lifetime: every receipt is hash-linked to its predecessor, so
an edit, insertion, deletion, or reordering *within* that lifetime is detectable. On its
own that leaves a gap at the seam, because a restarting process began a fresh chain at
genesis with nothing tying it to the one before, and a whole chain that disappeared was
indistinguishable from a pod that simply restarted.

:class:`ChainStore` closes the seam. The head is persisted out of process, and the first
record of each new chain is a ``chain_start`` receipt naming its predecessor and that
predecessor's head. The chains then form their own chain, so a missing lifetime is as
visible as a missing record, and ``scripts/audit-verify.py`` checks that linkage.
